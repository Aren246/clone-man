<!-- While working on this project I relied on YouTube tutorials, coding websites, and documentation like MDN and W3Schools to guide me. Along the way I’ve become a lot more comfortable with HTML and CSS, and I can see myself spending more time decorating the page and experimenting with design in future projects. I even tried a little stretch goal by adding an animated image to make the game feel more interactive for users, which was fun to experiment with alongside the JavaScript logic. -->

<!-- One thing I struggled with was learning how to fetch data from an API, which I wasn’t able to complete this time. I also struggled to remember about making commits on GitHub, but I will definitely keep working on this during upcoming assignments and use my self-learn hour to practice more. Even though I faced these challenges, I feel more confident now with JavaScript fundamentals, and I’m motivated to keep building on this progress and add more polish to my projects in the future. -->
